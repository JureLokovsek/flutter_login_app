# Flutter Login App Example

This is an example of an application made with Flutter. Here you will find three types of authentication through Firebase: Google, Twitter and email.

## Remember

1. First create a project in Firebase.
2. Add an application in Firebase (iOS or Android) and follow the steps.
3. Remember to add google-services.json to /android/app/.
4. Add the authentication methods of Google, Twitter and email and follow each of the steps indicated.
5. In the case of Twitter, remember to add the API Key and the API Secret. For example, I have created a file called "constants.dart" and put that information there.

**I hope it helps you**
